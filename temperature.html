  <div id="sensor" class="left">
    <p>The temperature sensor is built into the micro:bit.</p>
    <p>It is actually in one of the chips on the back, and it gets hotter during use!</p>
    <p>Work out what temperature your micro:bit is reading right now, then <strong>think about what problems you could solve by monitoring the temperature!</strong></p>

    <p>These two blocks of code are <em>equivalent</em>.</p>
    <p>The one on the left is good for quick testing.</p>
    <p>The one on the right is more useful to us, because you can use it to build more complex programs.</p>

    <h3>What can you use this for?</h3>
    <p>>As well as your <strong>Inputs</strong>, the blocks you need for this are in the <strong>Logic</strong> menu.</p>
    <p>As well as the <strong>Conditionals</strong>, you can combine <strong>Comparison</strong> and <strong>Boolean</strong> blocks to make a really interesting program!</p>
